-- Data Modelling - Like Planning a House Before Building It üè†

-- 1. Understand the requirements
-- What do you need? (like asking: how many rooms, what size house?)
-- Example: "I need to store customers, orders, and products for my online shop"

-- 2. Build a conceptual model
-- Draw simple circles and lines - NO DETAILS inside the circles!
-- Example: [Customer] ---- [Order] ---- [Product]
-- Just show what things exist and how they connect
-- Like saying "kitchen connects to living room" but not showing the sink or sofa

-- 3. Build a logical model
-- NOW add the details inside! (like detailed house blueprint)
-- Example: Customer(name, email, phone) / Order(date, total) / Product(name, price)
-- Still just planning, haven't picked MySQL vs PostgreSQL yet

-- 4. Build a physical model
-- Now get technical! (like actual construction with specific materials)
-- Example: CREATE TABLE customers (id INT, name VARCHAR(50)...)
-- Pick MySQL, decide exact column types, add indexes, etc.
